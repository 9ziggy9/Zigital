# Zigital
A digital logic simulator.

## About
Zigital aims to do primitive digital logic simulation via vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 canvas.
React is used as a UI to user settings and pallette selections. The POSTGRES db and backend api
is implemented via Flask/SQLAlchemy.

Zigital uses a finite state machine implementation to model the circuits in real time. Wire paths
are instantiated via A* and connections populate the FSM.

## Brief tutorial
It is best practice to place down components and then move on to wire, click inputs to outputs to
instantiate a component in the finite state machine. By clicking power sources (low/high voltage),
state will be updated and the results can be interpreted via connections to bulbs.
Left click to cancel path currently being drawn.
Note that delete will remove all components at the moment, I am looking to fix this shortly.

## Known bugs
- Currently deletion of wires is done in one foul swoop, a proximity deletion to a wire needs to be
implemented post haste to make quick modification of wires less taxing. -- SOLVED: lame solution
- Snap highlighting is missing on bulb and power components, this is a trivial fix. -- SOLVED
- Snap highlighting on gate imputs is slightly dubious, this will need to be rectified in order
to facilitate a clean instantiation of connection objects. -- SOLVED
- Dead links are currently left on the page as a development goal reminder, these will be removed
before true deployment. -- SOLVED
- Serialization of nested JSON objects in the database prove to be a non-trivial task. This is essential
for users to be able to save component abstractions and projects. Some more consideration needs to be made
as to how this can be accomplished with SQLAlchemy and Alembic. -- SOLVED

## Wishful thinking
- In the near future A* will be implemented as an alternative to manually routing wires, I
have actually already established the code base for this in a prior project (see my maze solving app)
but I need to do some more thinking on how to adapt the code cleanly. -- SOLVED
- The next step up from simple combinational logic would be to implement time-dependence in the form
of a simple clock.
